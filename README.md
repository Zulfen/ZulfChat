# ZulfChat
A really simple chat app made with Jetpack Compose. This project's code and structure will change quite a bit as I am using this project to learn Android development.

Using the awesome [Compose Destinations](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations) library by raamcosta for navigation!

Learning mainly using Philip Lackner's really useful tutorials. Here are some of the code / repos I have referenced to make this:
